#$ DESCRIPTION: These are the rates I've been using for a couple of years now for SBANG freestyle. I am a pincher, so these are pretty sensitive. They give a lot of center control but are still snappy out to the edges. Give them a try!

#$ DESCRIPTION: -----------
#$ DESCRIPTION: 
#$ DESCRIPTION: These rates are based on the Btaflight rate system and are pretty aggressive, with fairly sensitive center stick at 200 deg/s and full deflection rates at 900 deg/s. I have also added a slight expo to slow down the transition.
